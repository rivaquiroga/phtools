Description: phtools automates some of the tasks of 
    Programming Historian editorial team. The aim is to 
    give us more time to be awesome digital humanities editors, 
    and to avoid, when possible, frictions with our infrastructure.
    Currently, the package includes functions to check image
    filenames, check urls, and to browse the editorial guidelines.
